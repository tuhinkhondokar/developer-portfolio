            <p>
                Hello, as you know I am Tuhin Khondokar.
                I am trying to get enough knowledge about web development. I want to learn web development
                properly.That's why I am working hard.I want to reach my destination through by my hard work.I know I
                can do it easily.
                I have already learned html and css basic.I know that is very poor knowledge for web development.But in
                the initial moment that is good enough to see.That things build up my confidence step by step.Few month
                ago,I thought that I can't do anything in the subject at C.S.E.But when my friends told me about web
                development then I was impressed by their motivation.Now I am determind that,I would become a web
                developer soon.

                <h1>Before web development learning,my thought was:-</h1>
                <h2>In that time the date was around july in 2021.</h2>
                <p>As you know my name is Tofazzal Hossain Tuhin Khondokar.Few month ago I am always like to
                    think,what
                    I
                    need to do actually?In that time I didn't find any way,who can make the answer my question.After
                    few
                    days when I have told one of my friend about my thinking reason,then he told me about web
                    development.He
                    told me how can I get benefit from web development learning.He show me the opportunity in that
                    way.Then
                    I like to hear him cause I thought that,yes I can do something in that way,may be that is the
                    easiest
                    way for mine.In that reason I have decided to learning web development and build up my future in
                    that
                    way.If you guys think as like as mine,then you can learn web development properly and make your
                    future
                    easy.</p>

                <h1>After complete web development learning:-</h1>
                <h2>The present time is 2022.</h2>
                <p>Every people have a destination where they try to reach always.Someone reach their destination on
                    time,someone in late,and someone failed.As like as few month ago I have started my web
                    development
                    journey and for my hard work I have completed my web development journey on time.There haven't
                    any
                    time
                    bindings but in web development everyone need to practice properly and finish their work on time
                    what I
                    have done already.Now,I am the master of web development.I have learned html,css,jabascript and
                    so
                    many
                    things what I need in web development.In that time,when someone ask me that,what you are?Then I
                    can
                    make
                    my answer easily and answer those people I am a web developer.Really that answer make me
                    happy.At
                    last I
                    can say that,everyone can do something by their hard work."Thanks my Almighty".</p>
